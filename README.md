# Cybersecurity Lab
# Integrating Linux & Windows Systems with Advanced Monitoring Tools
<h2>Description</h2>
This project sets up a virtual environment using Oracle VM, VirtualBox with Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu Server VMs. Network configurations enable communication via IP addresses and NAT Networks. Security includes Splunk Server for log analysis, Universal Forwarder for data forwarding, and Sysmon for endpoint monitoring. Testing involves Crowbar for brute force attacks, Atomic Red Team (ART) for general tests, and Splunk log analysis. Windows machines join an Active Directory domain with Remote Desktop enabled. PowerShell scripting automates tasks for a hands-on exploration of cybersecurity concepts and tools in a controlled environment.

<h2>Objective </h2>
The objective of the lab is to provide a hands-on learning experience in setting up a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing and exploration. By creating and configuring multiple virtual machines (VMs) including Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu Server, the lab aims to teach skills such as network configuration, security tool installation (Splunk, Sysmon), endpoint monitoring, and security testing (using Crowbar for brute force attacks). Joining Windows machines to an Active Directory domain and enabling Remote Desktop also adds to the learning objectives. PowerShell scripting is used for automation tasks. Overall, the lab enables participants to gain practical experience in cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques within a controlled environment.

   <h2>Step 7: Conclusion</h2>
 In this project, I developed an automated user management solution for Linux, covering onboarding, access control, and offboarding. I created a Bash script to automate account creation with secure default settings, restricted SSH access based on roles, and implemented group-based access controls. The project also includes login monitoring for proactive security and regular user access reviews, ensuring that only authorized users have access. This demonstrates my skills in Linux administration, automation, and security, showcasing essential competencies for a System Administrator role.
